# Project: Multi-Region Disaster Recovery (DR) for a Microservices Application

## Description 
This project focuses on building a robust and automated DR solution for a microservices application deployed across multiple GCP regions.

## Define The business problems
Financial institutions heavily depend on microservices applications for core operations like online banking, stock trading, and fund transfers. However, single-region deployments expose these applications to outages caused by:

- **Regional Disruptions**: Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, power outages) can lead to complete service downtime.
- **Cyberattacks**: Targeted attacks on infrastructure or applications can compromise system availability and financial data security.
- **Technical Failures**: Hardware or software failures in the primary region can trigger unexpected outages impacting service delivery.

These outages pose significant business risks:

- **Financial Losses**: Downtime during peak trading hours translates to lost revenue opportunities and customer frustration.
- **Compliance Violations**: Regulatory bodies mandate high uptime for critical financial systems. Violations can incur penalties.
- **Damaged Reputation**: Service disruptions erode customer trust and damage your institution's reliability reputation.

**Solution Overview**

This Multi-Region DR solution addresses these challenges by leveraging GCP's robust cloud infrastructure with the following key features:

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: The application is deployed across geographically diverse GCP regions, creating redundancy and ensuring service availability during regional disruptions.
- **Automated Failover**: A robust system automatically detects outages, triggers failover to the healthy region, and updates traffic routing, minimizing human intervention and expediting recovery.
- **Data Consistency and Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on your chosen database (Cloud SQL with appropriate replication or Cloud Spanner), data replication strategies guarantee consistent financial data across regions, minimizing data loss and upholding regulatory requirements.

## Requirement
- Languages: version of Golang `go1.22.2`| version of python ``3.11``
- GCP:
  - ``Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)`` for containerized application deployment in both primary and DR regions.
  - ``Cloud Storage`` for storing application artifacts and configuration files.
  - Cloud SQL or ``Cloud Spanner`` for managing the application database.
  - ``Cloud Load Balancing`` for distributing traffic across application instances.
  - ``Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging`` for centralized application health monitoring and logging.
- Infrastructure Tools:
  - ``GitHub Actions`` for automating the CI/CD pipeline.
  - ``Docker`` ``KB8`` for containerizing and Orchestration the application.
  - ``Terraform`` for infrastructure provisioning and configuration management in both regions.
  - `Vault` for securely storing sensitive application secrets.
  - `ArgoCD` for GitOps-based application deployment and management.
- API Design 
    - `gRPC` for high-performance scenarios

## Features 
This project contains the following features:

- **Automated Failover**: Ensures seamless transition to the healthy region during outages, minimizing downtime and manual intervention.
- **Data Consistency Management**: Implements data replication strategies (like Cloud SQL with appropriate replication or Cloud Spanner) to maintain consistent financial data across regions and minimize data loss.
- **High Availability**: Achieves high uptime through multi-region deployment, enabling continuous operation of financial services applications.
- **Disaster Recovery Orchestration**: Provides an automated system for detecting outages, triggering failover, and updating traffic routing for swift recovery.
- **Security-Focused Architecture**: Leverages secure technologies like Vault for storing sensitive secrets and encrypts data at rest and in transit.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Employs Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration management in both regions, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
**Health Monitoring and Logging**: Utilizes Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging for centralized application health monitoring and logging, facilitating proactive issue identification and troubleshooting.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Integrates GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline, streamlining development, testing, and deployment processes.
- **Scalability**: The architecture allows for scaling application instances based on demand for efficient resource utilization. (Optional, if applicable)
- **Compliance Adherence**: Supports regulatory compliance for financial services with features that meet data security and uptime requirements. (Optional, if applicable)
